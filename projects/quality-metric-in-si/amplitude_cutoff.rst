Amplitude cutoff
================

Calculation
-----------

A histogram of spike amplitudes is created and deviations from the expected distribution are identified.

Expectation and use
-------------------

Deviations from the expected distributions are used to estimate the number of spikes missing from the unit (false negative rate).
This yields an estimate of the number of spikes missing from the unit (false negative rate)
